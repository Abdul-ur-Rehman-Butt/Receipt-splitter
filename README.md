# Receipt-splitter

This receipt splitter tool is a computer vision application designed to automatically identify and separate multiple payment slips from a single scanned document image. The program operates entirely offline using OpenCV and NumPy libraries, making it suitable for environments without internet connectivity or API dependencies. It employs traditional image processing techniques rather than deep learning models, ensuring lightweight operation without requiring GPU resources or large pretrained model files.

The core functionality revolves around two complementary detection methods that work in parallel to maximize accuracy. The first method uses contour detection, which identifies receipt boundaries by converting the image to grayscale, applying adaptive thresholding to create a binary image, and then finding closed shapes (contours) that match receipt characteristics. This approach is particularly effective for receipts with clear borders and high contrast against the background. The system filters potential receipts by size and aspect ratio to eliminate false positives, ensuring only appropriately sized rectangular regions are extracted.

The second, more sophisticated method combines edge detection with text region identification for handling complex cases where receipts might not have clearly defined borders. This dual-strategy approach first uses the Canny edge detector to find all edges in the image, then dilates these edges to form continuous boundaries around potential receipts. Simultaneously, it employs morphological gradient operations to detect dense text regions—a characteristic feature of receipts—and combines both detection strategies while intelligently merging overlapping regions to prevent duplicate extractions.

The program includes robust error handling and user guidance features. It automatically checks for the existence of the input file, provides directory listings if the file isn't found, and offers interactive prompts for correction. During processing, it displays real-time progress information including the number of receipts detected and their dimensions. The output is systematically organized into two separate folders containing both the individual extracted receipts and annotated versions of the original image with visual indicators showing detection boundaries, allowing users to verify the accuracy of the extraction process.

This tool is particularly valuable for digitization workflows where multiple receipts are scanned together, such as expense reporting, accounting document processing, or personal finance management. By automating what would otherwise be a manual cropping and saving process, it significantly reduces processing time while maintaining consistency in extraction quality. The dual-method approach ensures robustness across varying image qualities and receipt formats, making it adaptable to different scanning conditions and document types.
